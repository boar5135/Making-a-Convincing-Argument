<h2>Logical Steps to Debunking a Myth in Regards to My Cause</h2>
    
<h4>Present Core Fact:</h4>
    
<p>People cannot always tell whether or not a student is in need of special education assistance without testing or some type of evaluation.</p>
    
<h4>More Details about Core Fact:</h4>
    
<p>Not all students that require special education are in wheelchairs or have a noticible disability. In fact, most students have what are commonly known as invisible disabilities. These students may struggle socially or academically and may not always be identified immediatly because their struggles are not always visible. This often creates problems when it comes to providing aid to students that need it the most. Many school systems overlook these students and leave them in general education classes without aid. This results in many of these students failing these classes and leaving them with low self esteem. While many of these students can function beyond the essential skills classes, they do not belong in the general education classes. Oftentimes, schools do not have a class that can accomadate these student's needs that also provides them with some type of education that suits their specific abilities.</p>
    
<h4>Myth:</h4>

<p>Special education students always stand out, and the majority of these students get the help they need in schools.</p>
    
<h4>Explanation to how the Myth Misleads:</h4>
    
<p>This is misleading because it assumes that students with disabilities are easily identified. Additionally, it also does not take into consideration that students with disabilities have a wide range of abilities and that only having a general education and special education course will suffice.</p>
